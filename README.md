- 👋 Hi, I’m @mittens-codes
- 📚 I'm pretty new in the world of coding and still learning, so please have patience with me.
- 👀 I’m interested in LaTeX, R, Python and HTML, although I only have experience with LaTeX (and HTML, which I learned in school like 10 years ago).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning pretty much anything. As said above, I'm not very experienced.
- 👾 Admin of https://luks-passau.de/, made the website myself using NEVE, but still very proud of it 😌.
- ⛑️ I'm a paramedic trainee and work as an angel at various Chaos events (plz don't hurt yourself tho, there are simpler and more comfortable ways to meet me there).
- 💻 Currently working on a LaTeX presentation template in the corporate design of Uni Passau.
